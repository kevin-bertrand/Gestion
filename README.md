## Presentation
### Context
As a freelance, I must encode my turnover ever month on the application/website of the URSAFF. Being a young freelance means that you do not necessarily have the financial means to pay for software for managin estimates and invoices.
That's why I decided to create an application that would allow me to create estimates and invoices as well as to see the turnover made for a particular month or year.

### Needs
- All the creation and the modification of estimates and invoices;
- Be able to see the turnover for a particular month or year;
- Easily export an estimate to an invoice;
- Get the status of an estimate (in creation, sent, late, accepted or refused);
- Get the status of an invoice (in creation, send, paied, overdue);
- Shiwing an invoice or an estimate as a PDF.
